## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- Architectural decisions that affect multiple components
- Technology choices (databases, frameworks, libraries)
- Design patterns or approaches
- Trade-offs between competing solutions
- Changes to existing architectural decisions

### When NOT to Create an ADR
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary solutions or experiments
- Configuration changes
- Bug fixes

### ADR Numbering
Use sequential numbers: 001, 002, 003, etc.

### ADR Review Process
1. Create ADR with status "Proposed"
2. Discuss with team
3. Update based on feedback
4. Mark as "Accepted" when decision is final
5. Implement the decision
6. Update status to "Deprecated" or "Superseded" if later changed
